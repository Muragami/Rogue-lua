# Rogue.lua

**Rogue in Lua**
-----
Implemented from the [5.2 Berkeley source code](https://britzl.github.io/roguearchive/) of [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)).
This isn't a port, but a re-implementation. Not all behaviors will be the same, and a true copy was not the intent.
Instead it is meant to be a foundation upon which more can be built, and it is designed in an extensible way
using Lua tables.
